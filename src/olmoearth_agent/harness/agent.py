"""The lead-agent loop: brief -> LLM -> tool calls -> result.

A single-agent ReAct-style loop (DeerFlow v2's lead-agent shape, minus
subagents for now). The LLM sees the tool registry's specs; each emitted
tool call is dispatched and its result fed back, until the model returns
a plain-text answer or the turn budget is exhausted.
